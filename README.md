## Motivation
The biggest challenge to greater integration of solar power is its [intermittency](https://www.vox.com/energy-and-environment/2018/3/20/17128478/solar-duck-curve-nrel-researcher) and [unpredictability](https://www.vox.com/2015/6/19/8808545/wind-solar-grid-integration). Grid operators make up for this variability by keeping conventional plants on standby, and [curtailing](https://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/an-illustrated-guide-to-solar-curtailment-in-california) renewable generation once it crosses a certain threshold. These inefficiencies [raise generation costs](https://www.vox.com/energy-and-environment/2017/4/7/15159034/100-renewable-energy-studies), [distort price signals](https://mercomindia.com/solar-curtailment-issue-power-developers/), and harm grid stability. Accurate predictions mitigate much of this, allowing for better planning, increased resilience, improved dispatch of conventional sources, and reduced curtailment of renewables.

Solar forecasting however, is in its [infancy](https://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy16osti/65728.pdf), and is only getting harder as generation becomes more [distributed](https://www.vox.com/energy-and-environment/2017/12/15/16714146/greener-more-reliable-more-resilient-grid-microgrids). [Current](https://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy16osti/65728.pdf) [techniques](https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/#search/evhilton/LXphbRLrghxkrJpTdcKcVSSGCHmMKZkNfzlcqBqWgbB?projector=1&messagePartId=0.1) rely on near real-time smart meter data from small-scale installations, as well as hard to come by details like location, hardware, and panel orientation. Furthermore, much of this localized generation is consumed on-site and is invisible to operators, making net generation forecasting even trickier. As we transition to a cleaner, [decentralized grid](https://www.vox.com/energy-and-environment/2018/11/30/17868620/renewable-energy-power-grid-architecture) with thousands of distributed installations, this approach will struggle to scale.

In contrast, stable, simple, and accurate predictions can be generated by appropriately weighing the impact of regional weather variations on overall solar power production. Machine learning algorithms, excellent at determining the relationship of parts to a whole, are ideally suited to this task. Furthermore, the complex relationship between weather, installed capacity, and equipment efficiency is far more stable on an aggregate level than it is for individual installations. And with only weather forecasts, aggregate capacity, and system-wide power generation as dependencies, these predictions can be produced quickly, with minimal infrastructure and engineering overhead.


## Methodology

### Scope
Given the relatively [high](https://www.power-technology.com/features/mapping-boom-global-solar-power/) degree of solar penetration in Europe, and the [urgent](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/25/business/energy-environment/germany-electricity-negative-prices.html) need for smarter, more agile grids, this methodology is tested on operators across Germany, France, Spain, and Italy.

### Timescales
In keeping with industry practice, system-wide predictions are generated at both intra-day and day-ahead timescales. Day ahead forecasts are published the day before delivery, while intra-day forecasts, used to ensure grid stability and market clearing, are regularly updated throughout the day. In the absence of clear guidelines on when these predictions are made relative to the point of generation, we'll assume conservative lags of 1 and 24 hours for intra-day and day-ahead forecasts respectively.

### Data
Total installed capacity, weather conditions at a select number of representative coordinates, and historical generation patterns are used to predict aggregate solar power production across a given area of operation. 

Coordinates are selected based on the geographical distribution of solar insolation. The number of points is uniformly set at 5 to demonstrate the accuracy of a streamlined approach, but should be calibrated in production for maximum predictability. Actual weather conditions are used instead of forecasts to isolate the impact of a distributed approach, and make the methodology independent of the weather forecasting service used. This modularity ensures the easy incorporation of best in class, regionally tailored weather prediction models and satellite imagery. Equipment efficiency, instead of being quantified as an input, is inferred by the models themselves.



### Algorithms
A combination of tree ensembles and neural nets works well here. Trees are able to infer generation from the weather, pick up on seasonal patterns, and appropriately weigh conditions at different coordinates. But they struggle with new situations and long-term trends. Neural nets extrapolate better, and through the use of entity embeddings, capture rich, semantic relatonships between variables. The technique is detailed in [these](https://arxiv.org/abs/1604.06737) [papers](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1508.00021.pdf) and has been successful at [similar](http://blog.kaggle.com/2016/01/22/rossmann-store-sales-winners-interview-3rd-place-cheng-gui/) tasks.

### Validation and Testing
The models are validated on May - July 2018, and tested on August - September 2018. This period was chosen for two reasons:

- Generation is higher, more spread out, and harder to integrate in the summer than in winter
- The models need to perform well across both peak (July, August) and transitional, high variability periods (May, June, and September)


## Results
### Intra-day Forecasts
The approach performs quite well for intra-day forecasts, with a Median Absolute Percentage Error ranging from 3-5%. 

| Operator       | RMSE(MWh)| MDAPE(%)|   
| ---------------|---------:|--------:|
| ES             |168.5     |3.85     |
| IT             |278.1     |4.56     |
| FR             |130.1     |4.27     |
| DE(Amprion)    |146.9     |4.22     |
| DE(TenneT GER) |190.8     |3.49     |

This is encouraging, showing that a quick, lightweight approach can be relatively accurate for near-term forecasting.



### Day-ahead Forecasts

Results for day-ahead forecasts aren't quite as strong. 

| Operator       | RMSE(MWh)| MDAPE(%)|   
| ---------------|---------:|--------:|
| ES             |484.4     |9.95     |
| IT             |698.0     |8.67     |
| FR             |327.0     |8.82     |
| DE(Amprion)    |431.9     |11.52    |
| DE(TenneT GER) |850.1     |12.88    |
| DE(TransnetBW) |293.1     |12.26    |
| DE(50Hertz)    |827.4     |15.57    |

While the error is broadly acceptable, particularly for France, Spain, and Italy, the models struggle to predict abrupt peaks and dips. This is particularly evident for Italy below.

Better aligning coordinates with the actual generation profile should help ameliorate this.


## Conclusion
Using historical generation, annual installed capacity, and the weather at just five broadly distributed coordinates across an operators area of control, we're able to predict actual generation to within 5% and 12% for intra-day and day-ahead forecasts respectively. While not without its limitations, particularly for day ahead forecasting, the approach is quite promising. 


## Next Steps
The approach needs to be properly benchmarked against current forecasting techniques. This requires leveraging the same, likely better, weather predictions as the operators, having the same insight into curtailment decisions, and generating predictions at the same points in time, using the same lags. 

Better coordinate selection, in line with the actual geographic distribution of generation, will help ensure a fair comparison, and most likely improve day-ahead forecasting.

The number of coordinates was initally fixed at 5, to demonstrate the efficacy of a lightweight approach. This should be increased and calibrated for optimal performance.

The technique also needs to be tested on winter months.
